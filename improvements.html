<h3 style="text-align:center;"> <u>Sources of Error and uncertainty</u></h3>

<h3>Missing DATA: </h3><p style="line-height: 1.5em; text-align:left;">Some CT data was missing from the census years, including the one encompassing Chinatown. This most likely lead to the results showing the downtown core as being Gentrified in T1, and then as Gentrifying in T2. Since data is only missing from 3 CT areas in total, these missing data likely do not have a major impact on the rest of our analysis as the overall results show a consistent temporal movement of gentrifying to gentrified and gentrified to normal from T1 and T2 (when excluding the downtown core).
</p>
<h3>CENSUS DATA CATEGORIES: </h3><p style="line-height: 1.5em; text-align:left;">Census Tract data category groupings differed slightly from year to year, so there were some changes in the grouping of various data categories for the 4 factors used. For example the visible minorities Data for 2006 provided categories for Total Minority population and Total population with an aboriginal identity, whereas 2011 categorized these groups by gender, which were then summed.
 </p>
<h3> MISREPRESENTATIVE DATA</h3><p style="line-height: 1.5em; text-align:left;">Census Tract data can also be misrepresentative. There are a wide range of reasons why misrepresentation occurs, from the way respondents fill out Census forms to loopholes in government systems. Relevant to this study, the financial loopholes that some Vancouver residents use to avoid paying taxes will likely have affected our results causing some areas to be classified as containing a higher low-income population, when in reality they do not.
</p>
<h3>MAJOR EVENTS </h3><p style="line-height: 1.5em; text-align:left;">The 2008 recession could have abnormally impacted the change calculated in our study for T1 and Tt, as well as in the 2011 income and affordability data as the housing and job market experienced some profound changes during that time.</p>
<h3>FACTOR WEIGHTING  </h3><p style="line-height: 1.5em; text-align:left;">Another source of uncertainty are the weights associated with each classification factor for our MCE. These weights were selected based on what we felt were the most important factors in determining gentrification from our background research. Due to gentrification being such a complex phenomenon to define and quantify non-arbitrarily, the gentrification factors could be weighted in multiple ways. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to help address this issue with the final maps being a combination of an equally weighted MCE and an MCE where unaffordability was given more weight than the other 3 factors.

<p style="line-height: 1.5em; text-align:left;">Improvements that could be made in our study would be to increase the number of 5 year periods analyzed. This analysis used two 5 year periods, from 2006-2011, and 2011 to 2016. It would be useful to see if the patterns we saw in the final results hold for a longer time span of periods.
<br>
<br>
Using Different Spatial units, such as Dissemination areas would be useful to compare changes in gentrification patterns that occur because of scale or aggregation ( Modifiable Aerial Unit Problem).
<br>
<br>
Including more specific factors such as a renting to owner ratio (a more specific affordability factor), changes in business types (shows if local businesses are being displaced), field of education (fine arts, social sciences, tech, biological sciences, etc), field of work, amount of rezoning that has occurred in an area,
property values, etc, would lead to a more nuanced analysis. In this study we chose to use the most predictive
indicators of gentrifying change which we defined as variables being consistently used among other research and literature on gentrification.
