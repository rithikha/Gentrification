									<h3>Gentrification in the City of Vancouver</h3>
									<h1>GIS ANALYSIS </h1>
								</header>
								<h3>Our Approach</h3>
								<p style="line-height: 1.5em;"> In this analysis we focus specifically on “Bad Gentrification” and negative
									 change (which we use synonymously with “gentrification” here). We have pulled from an agglomeration of
									 observations and research (which are touched upon in the primer) to inform our own definition of gentrification
									 and identify which factors are important to explore:
								</p>
								<h3> Our Definitions</h3>
								<p style="line-height: 1.5em;"><b><u>Gentrification</u></b> is a process that that causes higher
									than normal negative change in an area <b>over a short period of time</b>. It has the side
									effects of causing demographic change, displacing the original resident population, and decreasing
									the social diversity of the area.

								</p>
								<p style="line-height: 1.5em;"><b><u>Negative Change</u></b> is defined as a change that hinders the
									 upward social mobility of any particular population. In this study we define negative change in
									 relation to our chosen factors which are used to indicate the displacement of vulnerable
									 populations in an area.

								</p>
								<p style="line-height: 1.5em;"><b><u>Social Mobility</u></b> is the movement of individuals on the social
									ladder of their society, this movement can be downward or upward.

								<h3> Abstract & Objectives</h3>
								<p style="line-height: 1.5em;">Using 4 different factors that are indicative of negative change,
									a multi-criteria analysis was conducted to explore gentrification in the City of Vancouver.
									 This analysis had two main objectives:
							</p>
								<ol style="line-height: 1.5em;">
									<li>Accurately identify patterns in gentrification over time using our model (validated through
										qualitative research/observations and any patterns that arise from our analysis)
									</li>
									<li>Identify which areas in the City of Vancouver are experiencing high amounts of negative change in the recent years
									</li>
								</ol>
<p style="line-height: 1.5em;">
								Our results show that there is a pattern of negative change in the city when looking at
								gentrification on a temporal scale of 5 year periods from 2006-2011 and 2011-2016. Six
								neighborhoods (Downtown Vancouver, Strathcona, Grandview Woodland, Hastings Sunrise, Fairview,
								and Kensington Cedar Cottage) were identified as being in need of intervention.
</p>
<h3> Gentrification Factors </h3>
<p style="line-height: 1.5em;">
We identified 4 main factors whose change over time (but not necessarily their values at one instance  of time)
 would indicate whether gentrification is taking place in a given area.</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.5em;">
 We chose to focus on the “negative” Gentrification factors (Number of low educated people in an area vs.
  Number of of high educated people; Minority presence vs. Majority presence, etc) as often times research
	 on gentrification focuses mainly on the incoming, displacing population rather than the displaced who
	 are most vulnerable. As <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Marcuse">Peter Marcuse</a><sup> 7</sup> writes,
	 <a href="https://nextcity.org/daily/entry/why-we-struggle-to-talk-about-gentrification">“there is next
	 to nothing published on the experiences of non-gentrifying groups living in the neighbourhoods into
	 which the much researched cosmopolitan middle classes are arriving en masse.”</a><sup> 8</sup>

	<h3> Affordability </h3>
	<p style="line-height: 1.5em;"> Changes in Affordability are one of the main indicators of displacement.
		 Gentrification is often paired with an increase in property values due to the forces of supply and
		  demand (whether gentrification occurs because of this or is the cause of the increase is still
			debated). As the neighbourhood becomes more popular, limited housing supply causes housing prices
			to shoot up and therefore become unaffordable for many of the original residents (especially those
			who are renting)<sup>9</sup>.
 </p>

	<h3> Income</h3>
	<p style="line-height: 1.5em;">Changes in income reflect demographic/diversity changes and can also
		help predict which areas are likely to become gentrified. Some studies have defined gentrification
		in such a way that, only those areas which are initially classified as low income can become
		gentrified. Due to the poor understanding of what specific mechanisms gentrification works through,
		 our analysis focuses on all negative change occuring in a city, regardless of where it occurs. A
		 change in the number of people classified as low income from high to low, can be an indicator of
		 displacement, especially if this change occurs over a short period of time<sup> 10</sup>.</p>

	<h3> Education </h3>
	<p style="line-height: 1.5em;">Education data can reveal information about the population that other
		 factors such as income do not provide much insight into, such as a person’s earning potential (a
		 student is likely not earning much while in school but their income after graduation usually
		 increases dramatically and their level of education can be used to predict their future income).
		 In this study, the assumption was made that income increases with education levels. While there are
		 many examples of people whose income does not reflect this assumption, we consider these cases as
		 anomalies. A change in a populations education levels from low to high would be an indicator of
		 gentrification as those with higher earning potential/current earnings have the economic power to
		 displace populations with lower earning potential<sup> 11</sup>.
 </p>

	<h3>Minorities</h3>
	<p style="line-height: 1.5em;"> Minority populations are valuable contributors to a city’s diversity.
		One of the main advantages cities offer over life in the suburbs are the opportunities for knowledge
		mobilization and dissemination that densely populated areas naturally facilitate. While studies have
		inconclusively shown that diversity can sometimes increase in gentrifying areas, it is probable that
		this is due to an overall increase in a city’s demographic diversity and it has generally been
		observed that gentrified areas become more homogeneous in composition over time.<sup> 12</sup></p>
