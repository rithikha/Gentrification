<h2> Data</h2>
<h3> Spatial and Temporal Units </h3>
<p style="line-height: 1.5em;"> Census Tracts were used as the spatial units as they remained relatively stable
	(compared to Dissemination Areas) from 2006 to 2016 for the timeframe of this study, which
	includes two 5 year periods, 2006-2011 and 2011-2016, and one 10 year period, 2006 - 2016.
	These different time frames were used in order to see how changes differed over a small and
	large temporal scale and to better identify patterns in negative change from one period to the next.

		<h2> Analysis </h2>

		<p style="line-height: 1.5em;"> The change from 2006-2011, 2011-2016, and 2006-2016 was mapped for
			 each factor. These were then normalized by population for each CT Area,
			 rasterized, and overlaid using a weighted sum.
		</p>


								<p style="line-height: 1.5em;">
									<h3> PART ONE</h3> Creating Base layers
								</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/methods1.png" alt="" /></div>


								<p style="line-height: 1.5em;">
									<h3> PART two</h3>Calculating the change occurring in T1 (2006-2011), T2 (2011-2016),
									 and Tt (2006-2016). Spatial Joins were used as CT Boundaries varied slightly from
									 year to year. CT areas that were missing data from either year were
									 removed from both map sets.</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/methods2.png" alt="" /></div>

								<p style="line-height: 1.5em;">
									<b> ATTRIBUTE TABLE CALCULATIONS</b> The Attribute table was directly manipulated to calculate the changes for the factors
									 over each time period. A sample of these calculations is shown below for T1. Inflation factors of 1.19 (2006 to 2016) and 1.11
									 (2006 to 2011) were multiplied to 2006 income data, and all factors were normalized by CT total population (population from
									 15-65 for the Education layer) before the difference was calculated.</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/methods2_2.png" alt="" /></div>

											<p style="line-height: 1.5em;">
									<h3> PART three</h3>Multi Criteria Evaluation. The vector data was converted into raster layers and then
									normalized using a Linear Fuzzy membership where the minimum value was set to 0 and the maximum was set
									to the largest negative change that occurred in each factor. (Hedge = SOMEWHAT to increase membership as
									only the highest amounts of negative change, a small portion of the overall data, were going to be considered
									 in the final maps). The 4 factor changes were combined using a weighted sum into one map showing overall
									 negative change for each time period. The weights are as follows: Unaffordability = 0.5, Education, Income,
									  Minorities =  0.1667.	</p>
										<div class="image main"><img src="images/methods3.png" alt="" /></div>

								<p style="line-height: 1.5em;">
									<h3> PART four</h3> A sensitivity analysis was conducted to see how the results changed if we were to use
									different weights for the MCE. The two MCE's (the original MCE favouring affordability and the equally weighted
									MCE) were then reclassified into 5 groups (given labels of  0,0,0,1, and 2 from lowest value group to highest
									value group). They were combined using a weighted sum (equally weighted) to produce the final maps for each
									time period. </p>
