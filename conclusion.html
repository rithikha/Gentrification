              <p style="line-height: 1.5em; text-align:center;">Jacobs notes that neighbourhoods experience an ebb and flow in negative and positive change. Even if an area experiences bad gentrification, she argues that “cities have an amazing capacity to reorganize and re-energize themselves”. A capacity that plays out like a game of Whac-A-Mole, where the dulling down and homogenization of one neighbourhood will “invariably lead to the rise of new, "energized" neighbourhoods elsewhere in the city” due to displacement.</p>
              <h3 style= "text-align:center;"> "WHEN A PLACE GETS BORING, EVEN THE RICH PEOPLE LEAVE"</H3>
							<p style="line-height: 1.5em; text-align:center;">
						While this is a testament to the resilience of communities that exist in urban hubs, it is the
						 duty of a city to address negative changes occurring within its scope. In numbers (and to the
						  outsider), bad gentrification often seems like progress, with low income, often shabbier
							 neighbourhoods being “cleaned up” and inhabited by highly educated, high income residents —
							 so in a city’s eyes, why should anything be fixed?</p>

  <p style="line-height: 1.5em; text-align:center;">
	After an area becomes gentrified, our analysis shows that this gentrified state becomes the “new normal”,
	therefore the neighbourhood takes on a new new baseline and the next time period shows that no out of the
	ordinary change has occurred. The problem with gentrification extends well past those negatively affected
	by it however. In short, homogeneity is not conducive to healthy, innovative, or competitive communities,
	whether these communities are <a href
