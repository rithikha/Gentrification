                  <h3>Gentrification in the City of Vancouver</h3>
									<h1>Discussion & Sources of Error </h1>
								</header>


                <p style="line-height: 1.5em;">
                  Jacobs notes that neighbourhoods experience an ebb and flow in negative and positive change. Even if
                  an area experiences bad gentrification, she argues that “cities have an amazing capacity to reorganize
                  and re-energize themselves”. A capacity that plays out like a game of Whac-A-Mole, where the dulling down
                  and homogenization of one neighbourhood will “invariably lead to the rise of new, "energized" neighbourhoods
                  elsewhere in the city” due to displacement.
                  </p>
                  <h3> "When a place gets boring, even the rich people leave"</h3>
                  <p style="line-height: 1.5em;">
                  While this is a testament to the resilience of communities that exist in urban hubs, it is the duty of a
                  city to address negative changes occurring within its scope. But why should a city care about the negative
                  effects of gentrification? Whats more, in numbers (and to the outsider), bad gentrification seems like
                  progress, with low income, often shabbier neighbourhoods being “cleaned up” and inhabited by highly educated,
                  high income residents — so in a city’s eyes, what’s there to fix?
                  </p>
                  <p style="line-height: 1.5em;">
                  After an area becomes gentrified, our analysis shows that this gentrified state becomes the “new normal”,
                  therefore the neighbourhood takes on a new new baseline and the next time period shows that no out of the
                  ordinary change has occurred. The problem with gentrification extends well past those negatively affected
                  by it because in the end, people are naturally repelled by homogeneity - not the rich or the poor, the educated or
                  uneducated, minorities or majority populations — simply put these areas become boring, and of concern to city government,
                  it becomes unattractive. San Fransisco and the changes it has seen in the past few years
                  are <a href="https://sf.curbed.com/2018/10/12/17968660/rich-poor-wealthy-residents-bay-area-study-uc-berekely">a perfect
                    example of this post-gentrification transition</a>, which also disproportionately affects
                  low-income, minority populations.
                </p>

                <h3>Errors and uncertainty</h3>
                <p style="line-height: 1.5em;">
                  Some of the errors in this analysis were that for 2016 and 2011 there were some data missing which resulted in a few
                   neighbourhoods having no information, including Chinatown which is one of Vancouver's most studied neighbourhoods on
                   the effects and processes of gentrification. This most likely lead to the results showing the downtown core as being
                    Gentrified in T1, and then as Gentrifying in T2. Since data is only missing from 3 out of the over 100 neighbourhoods observed,
                   these missing areas likely do not have a major impact on the rest of our analysis however as the
                   overall results show a consistent temporal movement of gentrifying to gentrified and gentrified to normal when excluding the downtown core.
                   </p>
                   <p style="line-height: 1.5em;">
                   Another source of error could be the weights associated with each classification factor for
                    our MCE. These weights were selected based on what we felt was
                   most important in determining gentrification and from our background research affordability was a constant factor that many studies
                   used in their analysis. Due to gentrification being such a difficult thing to quantify effectively,
                  classifications which indicate gentrification can be weighted multiple different ways while still being correct. </p>

                  <h3>Improvements</h3>
                  <p style="line-height: 1.5em;">
                  Improvements that could be made in our study of gentrification in Vancouver would be to increase the number of 5 year time periods to see if the patterns
                   we saw from time period to another hold for longer periods of time.
                   This would allow us to better determine if the changes observed are a result of normal city evolution or if it's a
                   result of gentrification. Including more specific factors such as a rent to owner ratio (a more specific affordability factor), changes in business types (allow us to determine if more
                     expensive businesses are moving in and pushing out smaller businesses), etc, would lead to a more nuanced analysis, however
                     given the constraints on time and datasets available to us, we chose to study the most used, and predictive indicators of
                     gentrifying change.

                  </p>
