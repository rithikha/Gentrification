										<h1>What exactly is Gentrification?</h1>
									</header>

									<div class="image main"></div>
									<h3 style= "align: center;"><b>A PRIMER</b></h3>
									<p>Gentrification is a complex issue that on the surface level manifests itself as an influx of
										middle/high-class people in a previously lower income area. Digging deeper however, gentrifications
										 roots lie in inequality, and this demographic change is usually observed with a revitalization of
										  infrastructure and amenities, the opening of new businesses catering to the upper class, a rise
											 in housing prices, displacement of the original residents, and a homogenizing of the neighbourhood
											 population. Whether these factors cause or follow in the heels of gentrification is still debated
											  and current studies on issues such as gentrification-related displacement have shown conflicting
									the widening gap between socioeconomic stratas that many urban areas are experiencing around the world
									today. As such, it’s a process that must be studied and addressed if we are to close this gap and provide
									communities with adequate opportunities for upward mobility — arguably the most important responsibility a
									 city has to its residents</p>

									 <h3> <b>Defintions & Theories</b></h3>
									 <p>
There are as many definitions and theories of gentrification as there are studies exploring it and stakeholder groups affected/causing it, each with often subtle yet important differences.

British Sociologist Ruth Glass first coined the term in 1964 to describe her observations of changes occuring in London’s districts:</p>
<p>
<i>“One by one, many of the working class neighbourhoods of
	 London have been invaded by the middle-classes—upper and lower.
	 Shabby, modest mews and cottages—two rooms up and two down—have
	 been taken over, when their leases have expired, and have become elegant,
	  expensive residences ... Once this process of 'gentrification' starts in a
		district it goes on rapidly, until all or most of the original working-class
		occupiers are displaced and the whole social character of the district is changed.”</i></p>
		<p>

This brings up the question of whether gentrification is just an inherent part of a city’s
evolution. A theory that is popular among many American urbanists though not without
acknowledgement of its negative effects. The idea was first introduced by urbanist and
writer Jane Jacobs, who did not classify gentrification as a solely negative phenomenon
as most definitions do today, but rather as a duality, a process with both positive and
negative effects which she classifies into two groups: “good gentrification” and
“bad gentrification”. </p>


<p><b>Good Gentrification</b> refers to a slower, deeper process of revitalization that provides the original residents pathways for upward mobility. Displacement is minimal and diversity in population, shops, amenities, and services are expanded yet remain accessible to the majority of residents. In an interview with the World bank, Jacobs explains that the start of gentrification, whether it turns out to be the good or the bad kind is “usually quite constructive”. This is because it can potentially kick start the process of “unslumming”, the ultimate goal of urban revitalization and somewhat synonymous to “good gentrification”, where if all the right factors are present, locals who have reached a certain economic threshold, decide to stay in a disadvantaged area by choice  instead of moving out. This decision to stay leads to a stronger community and greater economic clout — an intrinsically driven empowerment on economic and social levels.
 </p>

 <p><b> Bad Gentrification  </b>occurs more rapidly and the revitalization it brings occurs on much more shallow level. It can be summed up as a force that changes an area to become an “overpriced, overhyped and, crucially, homogenized environment.” New business and amenities arrive that operate in silos, catering to higher-income demographics and therefore isolating and excluding many of the original residents by limiting their access to important services and other enjoyments. Bad gentrification is characterized by displacement and ultimately a loss of diversity. While it may seem as if diversity is preserved in many of these areas, it is an artificial, deliberately invoked kind which is devoid of positive impact. Jacobs describes this homogeneity as, “a quality even meaner than outright ugliness or disorder, and this meaner quality is the dishonest mask of pretended order, achieved by ignoring or suppressing the real order that is struggling to exist and to be served.”
