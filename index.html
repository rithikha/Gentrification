							<h1>What is Gentrification?</h1>
						</header>
						<p style="line-height: 1.5em;">Gentrification is a complex issue that on the surface level manifests itself as an
							influx of the middle/high class into lower income areas. Digging deeper
							however, gentrification's roots lie in inequality, and this demographic change is usually
							observed with a revitalization of infrastructure, amenities, and services catering to higher-income communities, a rise in housing prices, displacement of the
							original residents, and a homogenizing of the neighbourhood population.</p>
							<p style="line-height: 1.5em;">Whether these factors cause or follow in the heels of gentrification is
								still debated and current studies	on issues such as gentrification-related displacement <a
								href="https://www.citylab.com/equity/2015/09/the-complicated-link-between-gentrification-and-displacement/404161/">
								have shown conflicting results.</a><sup> 1</sup>	Regardless, the widening gap between socioeconomic stratas in urban areas
								is a <a href= https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02723638.2016.1276718>precursor to gentrification processes</a><sup>2</sup>
								, which seem to be a ubiquitous phenomenon in cities around the world today. As such, it is an issue that must be studied and
								addressed if we are to close this gap and provide communities with adequate opportunities for upward mobility — arguably the
								most important responsibility a city has to its residents.

															<H2> Definitions and theories</H2>
								<p style="line-height: 1.5em;"> There are as many definitions and theories about gentrification and its mechanics as there are
									studies exploring it and stakeholder groups affected by/causing it, each with often subtle, yet important
									differences. British Sociologist Ruth Glass first coined the term in 1964 to describe her observations
									of changes occuring in London’s districts:
								</p>

								<!-- Blockquote -->
									<blockquote style="line-height:1rem;"><font size="-1"> “One by one, many of the working class neighbourhoods of London have been
										invaded by the middle-classes—upper and lower. Shabby, modest mews and cottages—two rooms up and two
										down—have been taken over, when their leases have expired, and have become elegant, expensive
										residences ... Once this process of 'gentrification' starts in a district it goes on rapidly, until
										all or most of the original working-class occupiers are displaced and the whole social character of
										the district is changed.”
									</font></i></blockquote>

							<p style="line-height:1.5rem;">
								This brings up the question of whether gentrification is just an inherent part of a city’s evolution.
								A theory that is popular among many American urbanists, though not without acknowledgement of its negative
								effects. The idea was first introduced by urbanist and writer Jane Jacobs, who did not classify
								gentrification as a solely negative phenomenon as most definitions do today, but rather as a duality,
								a process with both positive and negative effects which she classified into two groups:
								“good gentrification” and “bad gentrification”.
							</p>
							<H2> Good Gentrification and Bad Gentrification</H2>
							<p style="line-height: 1.5em;"> <b><i>Good Gentrification</i></b> refers to a slower, deeper process of revitalization
								that provides the original residents pathways for upward mobility. Displacement is minimal and diversity
								in population, shops, amenities, and services expand, yet remain accessible to the majority of
								residents. <a href="http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTUSU/Resources/jacobs-tacit.pdf">In an
									interview with the World bank</a><sup> 3</sup>, Jacobs explains that the start of gentrification, whether or not
									it develops into the good or the bad kind, is “usually quite constructive”. This is because small
									gentrifying changes can potentially <a href=
									"http://architectureireland.ie/gentrification-and-the-self-destruction-of-diversity"><sup> 4</sup>
										kick start the process of “unslumming”</a>, which is (arguably) the ultimate goal of
									urban revitalization and is somewhat synonymous to “good gentrification”. Unslumming occurs when locals,
									who have reached a certain economic threshold, decide to stay in a disadvantaged area by choice instead of
									moving out. This decision to stay leads to a stronger community with greater economic authority— an intrinsically
									driven empowerment of sorts on both economic and social levels.
								</p>
								<p style="line-height: 1.5em;"> <b><i>Bad Gentrification</i></b> occurs more rapidly (thereby making it a forced change in most situations) and the revitalization it
									brings occurs on much more shallow level. It can be summed up as a force that changes an area to become an
									<a href="https://edisciplinas.usp.br/pluginfile.php/4124196/mod_resource/content/1/Dirk%20Schubert-Contemporary%20Perspectives%20on%20Jane%20Jacobs_%20Reassessing%20the%20Impacts%20of%20an%20Urban%20Visionary-Routledge%20%282014%29.pdf
									"><i>“overpriced, overhyped and, crucially, homogenized environment.”</i></a><sup> 5</sup> New business and amenities arrive that operate
									in silos, catering to higher-income demographics and therefore isolating and excluding many of the original
									residents by limiting their access to important services and other enjoyments. Bad gentrification is
									characterized by displacement and ultimately a loss of diversity. While it may seem as if diversity is
									preserved in many of these areas, it is an "artificial, deliberately invoked kind which is devoid of positive impact"
								  as urban geographer <a href="https://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/homes/tslater"/>Tom Slater</a><sup> 6</sup> puts it.
