														<h3>Gentrification in the City of Vancouver</h3>
									<h1> Methodology</h1>
								</header>


								<!-- Text stuff -->
								<p style="line-height: 1.5em;"> Using the 4 identified factors (Income, Housing Affordability, Education Levels, and
									 VisibleMinority:Majority Ratio) we mapped the change from 2006-2011, 2011-2016, and 2006-2016 for each factor.
									 These were then normalized, and overlaid for each of the 5 year time periods using a weighted sum
									 (Housing Affordability given slightly more weight than the others). Our goal was to identify which areas of the
									  city experienced the most amount of negative (gentrifying) change for each time period.
								</p>


								<p style="line-height: 1.5em;">
									<b> PART ONE</b> The first step was creating our base layers
								</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/methods1.png" alt="" /></div>


								<p style="line-height: 1.5em;">
									<b> PART TWO</b> Next we calculated the change occuring in T1 (2006-2011), T2 (2011-2016), and Tt (2006-2016)
								</p>

								<p style="line-height: 1.5em;">
									<b> ATTRIBUTE TABLE CALCULATIONS</b> The Attribute table was directly manipulated to calculate these changes.
									A sample of these calculations is shown below for T1</p>

								<p style="line-height: 1.5em;">
									<b> PART THREE</b> The Multi Criteria Evalution was then conducted by first converting the vector data into raster,
									 normalizing the data, and using a weighted sum to combine the 4 factors into one map showing overall change for each
									 time period. The weights are as follows: Unaffordability- 0.5, Education, Income, Minoritity:Majority Ratio - 0.1667</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/methods3.png" alt="" /></div>

								<p style="line-height: 1.5em;">
									<b> PART FOUR</b> The final step was conducting a sensitivity analysis to see how the results changed if we were to
									 use different weights for our MCE. The results of the two resulting MCE's (the original weights and the SA MCE where all factors
									 were equally weighted) were then reclassified into 5 groups (labels as 0,0,0,1, and 2 from lowest value group
									 to highest value group). Finally the 2 MCE's were combined using a weighted sum where both were given equal weight
									 to produce the final maps for each time period</p>
